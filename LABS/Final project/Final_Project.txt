## Members of the group

Miguel Lucia Bayer

## Goal of the project

- Build a regression model to find the most important factors that determine airbnb prices in Europe. 
- Create an interface that predicts the airbnb price for users.

## Brief description of the dataset

The dataset source is Kaggle and it has 51707 rows and 17 variables:

3. room_shared: Whether the room is shared or not. (Boolean)
4. room_private: Whether the room is private or not. (Boolean)
5. person_capacity: The maximum number of people that can be accommodated in a single listing. (Numeric)

11. bedrooms: The total quantity of bedrooms available among all properties against a single hosting id. (Numeric)
12. dist: Distance from city centre associated with every rental property. (Measurement may vary depending upon scale eg kilometers/miles etc )
13. metro_dist: Distance from metro station associated with every rental property. (Measurement may vary depending upon scale eg kilometers/miles etc )
14. lng: Longitude measurement corresponding to each rental unit. (Numeric)
15. lat: Latitude measurement corresponding to each rental unit. (Numeric)
16. weekend: Whether it was booked during a weekend or only for weekdays. (Boolean)
17. city: where is the Airbnb located (Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Budapest, Lisbon, Barcelona, Rome, Paris, Athens and Vienna)

## Plannning of the project

### Data cleaning:
- Standarized columns
- Drop irrelevant features
- Replace null values
- Setting correct type of data
- Filter data

### Modelling:
- Build the regression model
- Compare the different regressions (Lasso, Ridge, OLS, LinearRegression)
- Error metrics
- Feature importance and remove unsignificant features that do not have correlation (feature selection using p-value)

### Visualization:
- Working in the visuals for the presentation
- Setting the storytelling

### Interface:
- Work on the interface of the airbnb recommender
